            A Privacy Policy is a legal agreement that details the personal
            information a website collects from visitors, and the ways in which
            that information is collected and managed. It is legally required by
            laws in California, the European Union, Canada, and other
            jurisdictions around the world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Protection of personal consumer information is the goal of privacy
            laws. Because more and more websites are collecting personal
            information to perform or improve online services, laws have been
            enacted to control and protect that information.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your ecommerce store likely collects names and email addresses for
            customer registration, and address and payment details for
            transactions. But this is only the beginning.
            <br />
            <br />
            Your store almost certainly interacts with third-party technologies
            such as Google Analytics, AdSense, or a blog platform or live chat
            tool. Third-party services such as these collect additional
            information from your online shoppers, such as IP addresses,
            locations, browsing activities, and more.
            <br />
            <br />
            All of this information is protected by privacy laws.
            <br />
            <br />
            An effective Privacy Policy clearly spells out the types of data
            collected through your store, how it is collected, why it is
            collected, and how it's recorded, stored, and deleted.
            <br />
            <br />
            It also should provide contact information for the departments and
            individuals responsible for upholding your privacy procedures, as
            well as instructions for customers to access, modify, or transfer
            their personal data.
            <br />
            <br />
            Furthermore, it should give consumers a chance to change, edit, or
            delete their own personal data, as well as the choice to opt out of
            sharing their data with you.
